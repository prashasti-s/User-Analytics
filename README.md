# User-Analytics
User Analytics Report

# OBJECTIVE:

The objective of the project is to analyse user activity and engagement on Instagram using SQL
queries. This means that the project will focus on understanding how users interact with the
platform, and how engagement can be optimized to improve user experience and satisfaction.
It is to help the marketing team launch effective campaigns on Instagram by analysing user
behaviour and engagement. This involves finding the oldest users of Instagram, identifying
inactive users who have never posted a photo, declaring contest winners, suggesting the most
commonly used hashtags on the platform, and providing insights on the best day to launch ad
campaigns based on user registration patterns. Additionally, the project aims to assess the
performance of Instagram on user engagement and identify any potential issues with bots and fake
accounts on the platform. By achieving these objectives, the project will provide valuable insights
to the marketing team and investors on how to optimize user engagement and ensure the long-term
success of the platform.
